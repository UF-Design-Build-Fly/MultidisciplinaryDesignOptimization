Future work:

Checkout out and organize folders so that old versions of analysis can still run.
Check all debug statements to make sure everything is polished.
Add code comments for every unit of measure.
Define a better way to call functions in main so that we know what variables a function expects to modify
    --> Probably accomplish this and data encapsulation by using class methods instead of casting everything as a struct
