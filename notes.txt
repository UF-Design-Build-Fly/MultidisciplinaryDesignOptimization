Things to improve for this year's analysis:


Add way more code comments. Pass your file around and see if everyone else can understand it quickly.
    each function should also have comments under the definition describing expected input, output, and a general use case
    format this comment in such a way that typing "help: {function name}" will bring up this text. Also comes up when hovering over function

Use object oriented programming to create code that is compact and readable.

Keep functions in seperate files to enable version control (GitHub) and readability. 

Expand powerSection function. Perhaps convert it to general lookup table with an index as input? Or is there some way to automate which power systems are analyzed?

Have standard system for reporting errors or impossible values (i.e the takeoff checker says we can't make it - we should just abandon the aircraft then and there)

Takeoff checker needs improvement - Bryce was not super confident about the existing results

Look for %DEBUG flags - these are notes I made of things that need changing when going over it with Bryce

If you don't know what a function does use a breakpoint and debug mode to "step into" it


Notes for Jack:

this year's analysis will be largely about improving style and efficiency - the basic physics are already really good from last year

Explain class system when we first start - use dot notation instead of an index in a matrix

Right now I'm not going to bother with private properties or methods - just trust that each function accesses only what it should. Subclasses might also solve this problem.

Define interface for each function before group gets started so they know exactly what variables they are allowed to use and modify.

Make a plan for analysis day where I introduce people to github, define their task

Make a convention for variable names by type? (underscore, camel_case, etc..)
    -->no acronyms! short words are ok (i.e fuse for fuselage as long as there's nothing else in the code that could be amiguous with)
