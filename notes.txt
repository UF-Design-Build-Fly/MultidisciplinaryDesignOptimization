Future work:

Check all debug statements to make sure everything is polished - be sure to write %DEBUG as a comment next to any code in progress or that needs to be checked
Add code comments for every unit of measure. This was a large source of error in 2021/22
Define a better way to call functions in main so that we know what variables a function needs to set/modify
    --> This is a problem right now because everything is used as struct instead of class. Mainly a style thing rather than functionality.
Make sure all variable names are descriptive and human readable. No acronyms! It's easier to write a long name up front than to try to figure out what it means later
The velocity solver breaks sometimes and returns a nonsense value. The whole genVelocity test should be reviewed.
